# Registration
This is a simple python registration script with a fully working signup and login function. It stores the username and passwords as base64 into the data.txt file which is **VERY UNSECURE** so if you actually want to implement this into your code, please modify it.
# Help
If you get an error saying "Module not found", type "pip install base64", "pip install replit", "pip install time", "pip install sys"
If this fix doesnt work please contact me on discord: MrFeast#5666
